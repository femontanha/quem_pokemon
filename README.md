# Quem é esse Pokemon?
### My personal project using Javascript and API for request the image and Pokemon name.

### A game where your objective is to identify who is the pokemon shadow.
You can have two options for this:
1: Typeing the pokemon name in the box "Nome do Pokémon" 
2: Choose the option "Mostrar Opções" where will show four name option, just choose by clicking.

Some Features:
- In the begin, you can choose the level of shadow, level 1 (easy), level 2 (medium) or level 3 (hard).
- Count of Right and Wrong answers.
- You can skip to another pokemon on "Tente Outro" button if you dont wont affect your score.
